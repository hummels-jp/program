# Cloud-Based Vehicle Event Collection and Usability Testing Toolchain PRD

## 1. Project Background and Significance

With the development of intelligent connected vehicles, data interaction between vehicles and the cloud has become key to improving user experience and safety. Traditional data collection methods suffer from data silos, poor real-time performance, and weak scalability, making it difficult to meet the needs of large-scale data collection, remote testing, and continuous optimization. This project aims to build an efficient and scalable event collection and usability testing toolchain, enabling automatic collection, remote testing, data analysis, and visualization to support product iteration and enhance user experience.

**Target Users**: OEM R&D, test engineers, product managers, data analysts, end users.

## 3. Requirements Analysis and System Architecture

### 3.1 Vehicle-Side Functions

- **Data Types**: Video, audio, sensors (acceleration, gyroscope), CAN, GPS
- **Collection Modes**: Event-triggered (hard braking, collision, interaction), manual/automatic tagging, scheduled collection
- **Data Management**: Local cache, encrypted storage, breakpoint resume
- **Interface Design**: Start/stop collection, get data, add/query event tags

### 3.2 Cloud Functions

- **Data Upload**: Support batch and real-time upload, status feedback
- **Storage and Indexing**: Structured storage (MP4/WAV/CSV/JSON), multi-replica backup, efficient indexing
- **Event Management**: Multi-condition search, synchronous playback, batch export
- **Permission Management**: Role-based permissions, fine-grained access control, audit logs

### 3.3 Usability Testing Toolchain

- **Task Distribution**: Remote distribution of UI/voice test tasks, parameter configuration, batch distribution
- **Data Collection**: Automatic recording of interaction logs, screen recording, voice input
- **Test Execution**: Multi-round testing, automated scripts, status tracking
- **Result Management**: Automatic archiving, report generation (PDF/HTML)

### 3.4 Data Analysis and Visualization

- **Data Processing**: Cleaning, aggregation, statistical analysis
- **Visualization**: Event playback, time series/heatmap/bar chart, multi-dimensional filtering
- **Trend Analysis**: Issue tracking, trend prediction, comparative analysis
- **Data Export**: Export raw data/reports, support filtering

### 3.5 External System Integration

- **API**: RESTful, support third-party data access and queries
- **Map Service**: Integrate OpenStreetMap for location visualization and route planning
- **Weather Service**: Integrate AccuWeather for real-time weather and forecasts

### 3.6 AI Model-Based Automatic Data Collection

- **Function Overview**: By integrating AI models, the system enables intelligent collection of multi-source vehicle data and automatic event recognition, improving the efficiency and accuracy of data collection while reducing manual intervention.
- **Intelligent Triggering**: The AI model can automatically identify events such as abnormal driving, collisions, and dangerous behaviors based on historical data and real-time sensor information, and trigger the corresponding data collection process.
- **Data Optimization**: The model can dynamically adjust the collection frequency and data types (such as video, audio, sensors). When key events occur, it automatically increases collection precision; during normal periods, it reduces frequency to save bandwidth and storage.
- **Self-Learning Capability**: Through continuous data collection and annotation, the AI model can continuously optimize event recognition algorithms, improving adaptability and accuracy in new scenarios.
- **Open Interface**: Provides standard RESTful APIs, supporting integration and upgrade of third-party AI models, allowing OEMs or partners to expand custom intelligent collection capabilities.
- **Privacy Protection**: The AI model's data collection and processing strictly follow data desensitization and compliance requirements to ensure user privacy and security.

## 4. Key Processes and Interfaces

- **Collection Process**: Event/manual trigger → multi-source collection → local encryption → breakpoint resume → cloud storage
- **Data Retrieval/Playback**: Multi-condition search → synchronous playback → export
- **Test Tasks**: Frontend creation → parameter configuration → distribution → device execution → data archiving → report generation
- **External Data Access**: API upload → format validation → storage → feedback

## 5. Data Format and Security

- **Collected Data**: MP4 (video), WAV (audio), CSV (sensor), JSON (CAN/GPS/event tags)
- **Interface Example**:
  ```json
  {
    "event_id": "UUID",
    "event_type": "Hard Braking",
    "timestamp": "2025-05-15T00:53:57Z",
    "associated_data": ["video.mp4", "audio.wav"]
  }
  ```
- **Security Measures**: End-to-end encryption (TLS/SSL), local/cloud encrypted storage, OAuth 2.0 authentication, permission control, audit logs
